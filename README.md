Read LPCM WAVE data.

This package is still in early beta.

## Roadmap

Eventually, Wavex will support reading and writing of any valid LPCM WAVE
file, as specified in _EBU - TECH 3285: Specification of the Broadcast Wave
Format (BWF), Version 2.0_, a copy of which can be found at
`priv/tech3285.pdf` in the source repository.
